    text: Normally, the keypad on my door tracks whenever someone enters and leaves
      my lab, which would be incontrovertible proof that I was where I said I was.

    text: But as it happens, my keypad was on the fritz last night, and so it wasn't
      able to track any entrances or exits from my lab until this morning, when I
      fixed it.
