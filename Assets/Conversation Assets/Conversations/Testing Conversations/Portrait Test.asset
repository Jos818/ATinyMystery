    text: Woah there muchacho! You should probably stop here! The full map hasn't

    text: Oh, okay. But what if I at least want to get a general sense for how the
      rest of the map is going to look when it's finished.

    text: Well... I suppose you could go through these lovely popcorn walls I've
      made, but it ain't gonna be pretty.
