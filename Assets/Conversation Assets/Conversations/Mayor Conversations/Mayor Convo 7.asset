    text: Well, besides me, there's the dust farmer, the mad scientist, and the fly
      who's incapable of lying.

    text: A fly who's incapable of lying?

    text: Yeah, Fly. His kind is incapable of telling anything but the entire truth.
      He's also very observant, so if something strange goes on around town, he usually
      knows about it.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 623c975874fd2f044b27a2aae34b1a3b, type: 2}
    text: That sounds incredibly convenient. I should really talk to him first.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 2c46b74383529ab4c891703d0784ad44, type: 2}
    text: Well you can find Fly in the house on the East Side of town, the farmer
      should be on his farm just outside of the West end of town, and the scientist
      will be in his lab in the Southeast.
