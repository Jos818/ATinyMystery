    text: Fly was a very young fly, in the prime of his life. He had a whole week
      before he even hit the average age for a fly.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 2c46b74383529ab4c891703d0784ad44, type: 2}

    text: And you chose to hide that fact?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: bf0113c933cc20d49a37133a0838b7ad, type: 2}

    text: This would all come together to suggest that you killed him and stole his
      amazing vest.
