    text: But now that you mention it, I really don't have any idea how to be a detective
      for real. I've read all about it, but I'm not really sure where to start...

    text: Well I'm no expert, but I bet if you snoop around and talk to the town
      residents, you'll come up with something. The people there are pretty friendly,

    text: Good luck kid. And one more thing. Make sure you talk to the mayor before
      you go interrogating some innocent civillians. He'll want to know what's going
      on.

    text: You can probably find him hanging around the town square. He should be
      pretty easy to find, with those mesmerising good looks of his.
