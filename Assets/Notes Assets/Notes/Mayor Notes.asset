  description: The "Mayor" of Tiny Town, the town located inside my bedroom wall.
    He seems to have some influence here with the residents.
  lines: []
  originallines:
  - He's actually Cy N. Post in a top hat... Or Cy N. Post is the Mayor without a
    top hat... I'm really confused.
  - He claims to not have been at the scene, because he can't move, but he obviously
    lied.
